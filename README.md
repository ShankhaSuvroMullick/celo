🗳️ VoteKing – A Simple Solidity Voting Smart Contract
VoteKing is a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that lets anyone vote between two fixed candidates — Alice and Bob — on the Ethereum blockchain.
It’s designed to be minimal, easy to understand, and fully deployable without any constructor inputs.

⚡ Features
🧩 No Inputs Required: Works right out of the box — no setup needed.
🗳️ Simple Voting: Vote for Alice or Bob using two easy functions.
🔒 One Vote per Wallet: Each address can only vote once.
🏆 Live Winner Check: Instantly see who’s winning using getWinner().

contract VoteKing {
    uint256 public votesAlice;
    uint256 public votesBob;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    function voteAlice() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You already voted!");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        votesAlice += 1;
    }

    function voteBob() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You already voted!");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        votesBob += 1;
    }

    function getWinner() public view returns (string memory winner) {
        if (votesAlice > votesBob) {
            return "Alice";
        } else if (votesBob > votesAlice) {
            return "Bob";
        } else {
            return "Tie";
        }
    }
}

🧠 How It Works
Deploy the contract – no inputs required.
Vote for a candidate by calling either:
voteAlice()
voteBob()
Once you vote, your wallet address is recorded to prevent multiple votes.
Check who’s winning anytime by calling getWinner().

🚀 Deploy on Remix
